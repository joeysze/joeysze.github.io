      My First Experiment
    </h1>
    <p> Hi my name is Joey Sze and my current progress in life is being a college
     student at University at Buffalo. To be more specific about myself, I am
     human that has been born on a planet called, "Earth" and I have survived a
     total of 17 years. 17 years and still counting. Life on Earth is harsh and
     the meaning of my birth is still questionable.
    </p>
    <p>
     What is the meaning of Life and for what purpose am I here for?
     Should I be thankful to whoever or whatever created me?
     Is being born on this planet a blessing or a curse?
     My perspective right now on Life is negative. I am not happy being here
     and humans are more evil than good.
    </p>
