    <p> Hi my name is Joey Sze and my current progress in life is being a college
     student at University at Buffalo. To be more specific about myself, I am
     human that has been born on a planet called, "Earth" and I have survived a
     total of 17 years. 17 years and still counting. Life on Earth is harsh and
     the meaning of my birth is still questionable. What is the meaning of Life
     and for what purpose am I here for? Should I be thankful to whoever or
     whatever created me? Is being born on this planet a blessing or a curse?
     My perspective right now on Life is negative. I am not happy being here
     and humans are more evil than good. Fuck My Life.
    </p>
